# Sarah's Interview Continuation Feature

I've implemented the interview continuation feature for Sarah. This allows clients to pause an interview and resume it later, even if they call from a different phone number. Here's how it works:

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Sarah's System Prompt Update
Sarah now has instructions to:
- Recognize when a client wants to end the call early
- Let them know they can continue later
- Acknowledge returning clients and reference previous conversations

### 2. End Call Phrases
Added new phrases to recognize when a client wants to pause:
- "i understand you need to go"
- "we can continue this later"
- "let's pause here and continue next time"

### 3. Continuation Handler Script
Created `sarah-continuation-handler.js` which provides:
- Storage of conversation history by email address
- Retrieval of previous conversations when a client calls back
- Context preparation for Sarah about where the previous conversation left off

## How It Works

1. **Initial Call**:
   - Sarah asks for name and email (as she already does)
   - If client needs to end early, Sarah acknowledges and offers to continue later
   - System stores the conversation with the email as the unique identifier

2. **Follow-up Call**:
   - Sarah asks for name and email (standard procedure)
   - System checks if there's a previous incomplete conversation
   - If found, Sarah is informed about the previous context
   - Sarah acknowledges: "I see we have a previous conversation. Last time we spoke about [topic]. Would you like to continue where we left off?"

3. **Behind the Scenes**:
   - The continuation handler processes completed calls
   - It extracts client information and conversation context
   - It determines if an interview was complete or interrupted
   - It prepares context for continuation calls

## Implementation Notes

- The continuation handler uses in-memory storage for demonstration purposes
- In production, you would connect it to a database
- You'll need to set up webhooks in Vapi to call these functions when calls start and end
- The system uses email address as the unique identifier, not phone number

## Next Steps

1. **Set up a database** to store conversation history (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.)
2. **Deploy the continuation handler** as a web service
3. **Configure Vapi webhooks** to call your service when calls start and end
4. **Test the continuation flow** with a real client

## Testing the Feature

To test this feature:
1. Call Sarah at 850.952.9047
2. Provide your name and email
3. Have a short conversation
4. Say you need to go and will continue later
5. Call back later (even from a different number)
6. Provide the same name and email
7. Sarah should recognize you and offer to continue where you left off

This feature enhances Sarah's capabilities by making the interview process more flexible and client-friendly, allowing for deeper, more thoughtful conversations across multiple sessions.
