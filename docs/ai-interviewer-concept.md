# Self Cast Studios AI Interviewer Concept

## Overview
This document outlines the concept for an AI voice interviewer that could replace the human interviewer (Speaker 1) in Self Cast Studios' 60-minute workshop sessions. The AI would conduct structured interviews to capture clients' voice, tone, style, and content for website creation.

## Current Workshop Process
1. 60-minute recorded interview with a human interviewer (Speaker 1)
2. Conversation transcribed to VTT file
3. Content from client responses (Speaker 2) extracted and processed
4. Processed content used to create website, blog posts, and social media content

## Interview Structure
Based on analysis of existing workshop transcripts, the interview follows this general structure:

### 1. Introduction and Purpose Setting
- Explanation of the workshop's purpose
- Overview of how the information will be used
- Setting expectations for the process

### 2. Background and Journey Questions
- Personal history and professional background
- Key life experiences that shaped their path
- Turning points or pivotal moments in their journey

### 3. Current Focus and Offerings
- What they're currently promoting or focusing on
- Services or products they provide
- Target audience and who they help

### 4. Values and Philosophy
- Core beliefs that drive their work
- What makes their approach unique
- Personal philosophy about their field

### 5. Client Success Stories
- Examples of people they've helped
- Transformations they've facilitated
- Impact of their work

### 6. Future Vision
- Where they see themselves going
- Goals and aspirations
- New directions they're exploring

## Common Questions
These questions could be adapted for an AI voice interviewer:

1. "Tell me about what you're currently promoting or focusing on in your business."
2. "Could you share a bit about your background and how you got to where you are today?"
3. "What was the journey like that led you to this particular field or specialty?"
4. "Were there any pivotal moments or experiences that significantly shaped your path?"
5. "What makes your approach unique compared to others in your field?"
6. "Who are the people you typically work with, and what challenges do they face?"
7. "Can you share a story about someone you've helped and the transformation they experienced?"
8. "What core values or beliefs guide your work?"
9. "How would you describe your philosophy about [their field]?"
10. "What are you most passionate about in your work?"
11. "Where do you see yourself or your business going in the future?"
12. "Is there anything we haven't covered that you feel is important to share?"
